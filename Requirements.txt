# MATLAB Requirements for ADSP Project
# Project: High-Resolution Spectral Zooming for Radar Sensing using CZT

1. MATLAB Environment:
   - Minimum Version: MATLAB R2021a (or newer recommended)

2. Required Toolboxes:
   - Signal Processing Toolbox (Required for kaiser(), awgn(), etc.)
   - Communications Toolbox (Optional, fallback for specific noise generations)

3. Hardware Requirements (for accurate Runtime Benchmarking):
   - A standard multi-core CPU (e.g., Intel Core i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen)
   - Note: Execution times in Exp 2 may vary depending on the host CPU, but the O(1) complexity trend will remain identical.
